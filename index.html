        <p>My school life has been an amazing journey so far. I started my education in a small primary school and then
          moved on to a bigger secondary school. Throughout my school life, I have been fortunate enough to have
          experienced a positive and supportive learning environment. I have made many great friends, learned valuable
          lessons and developed my passion for learning.

          My school life has not just been about studying and getting good grades, it has also been about
          extracurricular
          activities and sports. I have been a member of the school's debate club, music club and basketball team.
          Participating in these activities has not only helped me to build my skills and confidence, but it has also
          allowed me to meet new people and form new relationships.</p>

      <div class="ourAchievements_mainDiv">
        <p>Academic achievement or academic performance is the extent to which a student, teacher or institution has
          attained their short or long-term educational goals. Completion of educational benchmarks such as secondary
          school diplomas and bachelor's degrees represent academic achievement.

          Academic achievement is commonly measured through examinations or continuous assessments but there is no
          general agreement on how it is best evaluated or which aspects are most importantâ€”procedural knowledge such as
          skills or declarative knowledge such as facts.[1] Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which
          individual factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment,
          motivation, and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement.</p>
